## 1. Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around objects. Objects are instances of classes, which can have attributes (data) and methods (functions). OOP aims to model real-world entities as objects and solve problems by creating interactions between them.

## 2. Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties and behaviors that objects of that class will have. An object is an instance of a class, representing a specific entity with its own unique set of attribute values.

## 3. Attributes

### A. Instance Attributes

Instance attributes are specific to each instance (object) of a class. They hold data related to that particular instance.

### B. Class Attributes

Class attributes are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any methods.

## 4. Methods

### A. Instance Methods

Instance methods are functions that can access and modify instance attributes of an object.

### B. Class Methods

Class methods are bound to the class itself and take the class as the first argument (`cls`).

### C. Static Methods

Static methods are functions defined within a class but are not bound to any instance or the class itself.

## 5. Inheritance

### A. Single Inheritance

Single inheritance allows a class to inherit from a single parent class.

### B. Multiple Inheritance

Multiple inheritance allows a class to inherit from multiple parent classes.

## 6. Polymorphism

### A. Method Overriding

Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its base class.

### B. Operator Overloading

Operator overloading allows customizing the behavior of operators for user-defined classes.

## 7. Encapsulation and Abstraction

### A. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods within a single unit, hiding internal details from the outside world.

### B. Abstraction

Abstraction exposes only the essential features of an object while hiding unnecessary details.

## 8. Example Class

The tutorial includes an example implementation of a `BankAccount` class, demonstrating various OOP concepts in practice.

## Usage

To use this tutorial, simply navigate through the sections and follow the explanations and code examples provided. Each section covers a specific OOP concept, with clear explanations and relevant code snippets to help you understand and practice the concepts.

Feel free to modify the code examples or create your own classes and objects to solidify your understanding of OOP in Python.
